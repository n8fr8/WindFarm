#WIND FARM ZERO: MAY 15-16, 2015

##OVERVIEW

Wind is the untapped energy that is all around us.  spontaneous and often unexpected. It can manifest as a slight breeze, or a powerful gale. It can move in many directions and as a focused force. It can gently spread the seeds of life, and be a fearful force of destruction. Wind can carry a message for miles, even around the world. Wind can be harnessed and turned into energy. Wind, in this case, is a metapor to describe something that is not the Internet, and it is not the Web, but something new.

Wind Farm Zero is an attempt to facilitate a basic vision and metaphor for us to all work within. It is a starting point, not a standard, an intervent to create a dialogue, shared terminology and potentially shared narrative of how, who and what we expect people to do when they have a super-computer in their pocket, but no Internet. We will hear first hands stories from people who have experienced network-less situations (hurricanes, earthquakes, protests), and share new promising projects, protocols and products that can address these times. Most importantly, we'll have time to be hands-on with a large group of people moving around in the real world, to see what works and does not work today.

This Wind Farm event builds on an "Internet Blackout Simulation Event" held in 2013 in New York at Eyebeam. You can learn more about that event at the links below:

##AGENDA

###DAY ONE: Discusions, Demoes and Dreams

Day one will be a semi-private session of invited participants and members of the Berkman community. We will try to find common ground between our various efforts in non-Internet, nearby, "mesh" communication systems, while having room to share our divergent views on what the future of device-to-device communications will look like. We will hear from everyday people, activists, aid workers and others who have direct experience being and working in places where all traditional communications are down, or are otherwise not viable. We will have the chance to share with eachother our coolest, cutting edge demoes and/or our actually shipping, production ready products. Finally, we'll attempt to come away with some basic ideas for collaboration moving forward, which might be helped by sharing a few beers and dinner.
   
##DAY TWO: Have Fun and Break Things!

Day two will be more open to a larger community, and will include a more diverse set of participants, including students from the local colleges and high schools. The aim is to expand our theoretical discussions from day one into a hands-on, "live action" game situation, where we can see how different apps, tools, prototypes and services fare when put int the hands of real people. Our hope is to be able to test released solutions at some sort of scale, meaning 30-50 people, potentially. We will be using the Harvard campus as our game space, and the variations on capture the flag and scavenger hunts as the basis of the games, but with all communication occuring via the apps provided.
